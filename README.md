**Learn programming techniques to build effective, maintainable, and readable code in Rust 2018**

## What is this book about?
Rust has come a long way and is now utilized in several contexts. Its key strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers, and performance-critical applications, not forgetting its importance in systems' programming. This book will be your guide as it takes you through implementing classic data structures and algorithms in Rust, helping you to get up and running as a confident Rust programmer.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Design and implement complex data structures in Rust 
Analyze, implement, and improve searching and sorting algorithms in Rust 
Create and use well-tested and reusable components with Rust 
Understand the basics of multithreaded programming and advanced algorithm design 
Become familiar with application profiling based on benchmarking and testing 
Explore the borrowing complexity of implementing algorithms

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
fn my_function() {
    let x = 10;
    do_something(x); // ownership is moved here
    let y = x; // x is now invalid!
}
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Claus Matzinger**
is a software engineer with a very diverse background. After working in a small company maintaining code for embedded devices, he joined a large corporation to work on legacy Smalltalk applications. This led to a great interest in programming languages early on, and Claus became the CTO for a health games start-up based on Scala technology.

Since then, Claus' roles have shifted toward customer-facing roles in the IoT database-technology start-up crate.io and, most recently, Microsoft. There, he hosts a podcast, writes code together with customers, and blogs about the solutions arising from these engagements. For more than 5 years, Claus has implemented software to help customers innovate, achieve, and maintain success.
